# Cryo-EM image alignment: from pair-wise to joint with deep unsupervised difference learning

## Introduction
We provide source code, used data and some additional support for our paper. 
- In folder `Code`, source code is provided for all utilities including network training on nature/synthetic cyro-EM/real-world cryo-EM images, synthetic data generation and so on. Rich comments and instructions are provided.
- In folder `Data`, center images to generate synthetic datasets and sampled MS-COCO images are provided.
- In folder `Additional`ï¼Œwe provide code to generate binary files of well-trained models and show how to use well-trained model/its results in other program such as EMAF.
